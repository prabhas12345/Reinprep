There are also privileged customers 
who can earn bonus points for each of their transaction. 
This scenario is depicted through the below class diagram.

Customer
- customer_id
- customer_name
- age
- account
_init_(customer_id, customer_name, age, account)
+ withdraw(amount)
+ take_card()
+ get_customer_id()
+ get_customer_name()
+ get_age()
+ get_account()
Account
- account_type
- balance
- min_balance
_init_(account_type,balance,min_balance)
+ get_account_type()
+ get_balance()
+ get_min_balance()
+ set_balance(balance)
PrivilegedCustomer
- bonus_points
_init_ (customer_id, customer_name, age, account, 
bonus_points)
+ withdraw(amount)
+ get_bonus_points()
- increase_bonus()
OverdrawException
LimitReachedException

RULES TO FOLLOW
================
Customer:
withdraw(amount): This method should reduce the account balance based on the
amount withdrawn. Raise the following exceptions based on the given conditions.
OverdrawException - If the amount to be withdrawn is greater than account balance.
LimitReachedException - If the balance amount is less than minimum account balance.
take_card(): Displays the message "Take card out from the ATM".
PrivilegedCustomer:
increase_bonus(): If the account balance is greater than 1000, increase the bonus points by 10, else increase it by 2.
withdraw(amount): Invoke the parent class withdraw() method and increase the bonus points by calling increase_bonus() method, if no exceptions occured.
If exceptions occur, display relevant messages. Ensure that the card is taken out from the ATM under any situation.
=================
Write a Python program to create a new PrivilegedCustomer with below details:
Customer Id: 100
Customer Name: Gopal
Age: 43
Bonus Points: 100
Account Type: Savings
Account Balance: 1000
Account minimum: 500

The customer should be able to withdraw money and also display the bonus points of the customer after the withdraw.
